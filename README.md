Blog replacement site


Plan of actions:
1) set up models
2) construct front end react with place holder cards
3) finish back end set up
4) add messaging and chat functionality



Questions:
1) how to upload documents (let's say only PDF) and how does this connect with the models
2) admin control
3) should their be user log in
4) what will be the messaging feature - an email sign up/newsletter?
5) What is MVP for this site?
